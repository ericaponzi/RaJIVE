Description: RaJIVE (Robust Angle based Joint and Individual Variation Explained) is a robust alternative to the aJIVE method for the estimation of joint and individual components in the presence of outliers in multi-source data. It decomposes the multi-source data into joint, individual and residual (noise) contributions. The decomposition is robust to outliers and noise in the data.
